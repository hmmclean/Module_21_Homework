Module 21 - Deep Learning Challenge

# Overview of the analysis: 
The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. Using machine learning and neural networks, youâ€™ll use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. 

# Results: 
Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions.

Data Preprocessing
-------------------
* What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
    * The targets are the successful applicants. Within the dataset, this column is labeled as IS_SUCCESSFUL. 
* What variable(s) are the features for your model?
    * The features are all the other columns in the dataset. This includes but is not limited to, application types, income, ask amount, affiliation, and classification. 
* What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
    * EIN and NAME columns can be removed as they are neither targets nor features. 

Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
---------------------------------------------
* How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
* Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
* What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?

# Summary: 
Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.
